The code in this repo is public code from my summer project with Google's Liquid Galaxy. 

Code written in JavaScript. 

You will need to enable Google Maps API. Click here to get your API key: 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

To run the code, open in simple platform like Notepad++, for example. Then save as HTML file. If your Google Maps API is set up properly, it will display in your browser.
